**There you will find a part of our project for Big Data Sirius Challenge!**
----------------------
**Requirements**
----------------------

_Firstly, you need install `vk_api` for vk api controlling - it is very beautiful library that will help you with this horrible api. Secondly, `tortoise` for data managing. Some word about chosen instruments: `tortoise` is a really cool thing with `ORM` technologies._

----------------------
**Installation**
-----------------------

1) `pip install vk_api tortoise` - that's all you need for raise such bot
2) You should set env variables - `TOKEN`(your group's token), `BASE_ADDRESS`(address of database, where you are planning to save all the information) and `GRP_ID` (your vk-managed group's id)
